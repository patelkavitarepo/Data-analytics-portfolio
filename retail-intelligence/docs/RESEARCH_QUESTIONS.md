# Research log — Project 003

## R001 — What is a valid sales transaction?

**Status:** partially investigated; raw overlap verified, business classification still open.

- A row represents a line item, not necessarily a distinct order or customer.
- UCI documents `C`-prefixed invoice codes as cancellations.
- Initial investigation: [negative quantity findings](NEGATIVE_QUANTITY_FINDINGS.md) — 19,493 negative C-prefixed lines, 3,457 negative non-C lines, and one positive C-prefixed line.
- All 3,457 negative non-C rows have zero unit price, missing customer ID, and UK country; 2,689 lack product description. Possible internal adjustments are a **hypothesis**, not an established label.
- Further investigate refunds, non-merchandise codes, invoice-level groups, zero-priced lines, and duplicate records.
- Do not define revenue solely as `Quantity * UnitPrice` without explaining exclusions, cancellations, and the monetary meaning of the resulting figure.

## R002 — Are monthly or geographic differences meaningful?

**Status:** open, not yet tested.

- Check temporal completeness, seasonality, geography, and the effect of major wholesale orders.
- Avoid attributing trends to marketing or customer behavior without corroborating data.

## R003 — What can customer IDs tell us?

**Status:** open, not yet tested.

- Quantify missing customer IDs before estimating repeat-purchase rates or RFM segmentation.
- Document that anonymous transactions cannot confidently be attributed to individuals.

## Evidence discipline

Separate source metadata, observed audit counts, assumptions, and business interpretations. Record every cleaning/filter decision and its row impact before using it downstream. No dashboard or final narrative is approved yet.
